# Lunch Menu Recommendation App

A simple Flask application that receives user input and returns a lunch menu recommendation using a generative AI model.

현재 사용자는 어제 점심, 오늘 아침, 기분, 먹고 싶은 음식의 특성을 입력하면, AI를 통해 추천 점심 메뉴를 반환하는 간단한 웹 애플리케이션입니다.

## Current Features
- Input form for user data
- Recommendation generated by calling a generative AI (Vertex AI Gemini)

## Future Plans
- Enhance website decoration and UI improvements
- Improve recommendation logic using additional data
- Implement user registration and store user history for personalized recommendations
- Collect satisfaction ratings (star reviews) for feedback and machine learning
